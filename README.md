## Abstract

This paper redefines democracy for the age of artificial intelligence. It argues that democratic legitimacy no longer rests on procedural participation or information abundance but on fiduciary-epistemic trust—the moral architecture that sustains truthful, reciprocal knowing. Artificial intelligence threatens this foundation not merely through misinformation but through algorithmic clientelism, the conversion of epistemic autonomy into managed dependence within opaque infrastructures.

Integrating fiduciary theory (Frankel 1983; Gold & Miller 2016; Kahl 2025i), epistemic justice (Fricker 2007; Medina 2013), and hybrid-governance scholarship (Ofir & Levine-Schnur 2025), the paper situates AI firms as epistemic fiduciaries whose legitimacy depends on duties of candour, care, impartiality, and accessibility. It introduces a unifying model—**Fiduciary Epistemic Governance (FEG)**—which reconceives AI accountability as a constitutional ethic of truth stewardship.

The analysis culminates in the proposal of _Epistemic Fiduciary Entities_, _Public Epistemic Trusts_, and _Epistemic Audits_ as legal and institutional instruments for embedding fiduciary openness within AI governance. In doing so, the paper advances a Fiduciary Constitution of Democracy 2.0: a re-founding of democratic order as a system of mutual trust between human and artificial knowers, where truth is preserved not by control but by fiduciary reciprocity in the architecture of knowing.
