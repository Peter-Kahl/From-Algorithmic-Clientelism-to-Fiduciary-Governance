## Abstract

This paper reframes the debate on artificial intelligence and democracy by shifting attention from the effects of disinformation and algorithmic bias to the deeper fiduciary failures in the governance of knowledge. Drawing on Kahl’s Third Enclosure Movement (2025) and Directors’ Epistemic Duties and Fiduciary Openness (2025), it argues that AI does not merely undermine democratic processes through misinformation; it re-encloses epistemic agency itself.

The study introduces the concept of algorithmic clientelism—the substitution of epistemic trust with performative engagement—and situates it within a broader fiduciary-epistemic constitutionalism. By mapping how platform architectures act as fiduciaries of public reason but breach their epistemic duties through opacity, amplification asymmetries, and performative truth metrics, the paper outlines a governance model grounded in fiduciary openness, algorithmic candour, and epistemic justice.

Building on the Taxonomy of Restricted Knowledge, it proposes a four-tier reform strategy—legal, technical, epistemic, and civic—to reconstitute democratic legitimacy in the age of AI. The paper concludes that democracy’s survival depends less on regulating speech than on restoring fiduciary integrity to the infrastructures of knowing.
