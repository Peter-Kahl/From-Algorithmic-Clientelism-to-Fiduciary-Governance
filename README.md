## Abstract

This paper reconceptualises the relationship between artificial intelligence and democracy through the lens of fiduciary-epistemic ethics. It argues that AI does not merely threaten democracy through misinformation or automation but through epistemic capture—the reconfiguration of public trust into clientelist dependence mediated by opaque, algorithmic infrastructures. Drawing upon fiduciary theory (Frankel 1983; Gold & Miller 2016; Kahl 2025i), epistemic justice (Fricker 2007; Medina 2013), and recent corporate-law scholarship on hybrid governance (Ofir & Levine-Schnur 2025), the paper situates large AI firms as fiduciaries of knowledge, entrusted with public epistemic goods yet structured to breach those duties through opacity and self-referential accountability.

Synthesising Kahl’s _Epistemic Clientelism Theory_ with Coeckelbergh’s (2025) insights on epistemic agency, the paper introduces a new framework—**Fiduciary Epistemic Governance** (FEG)—that grounds algorithmic accountability in duties of candour, care, and openness. It concludes by proposing institutional reforms, including algorithmic fiduciary duties, epistemic audits, and the establishment of _Public Epistemic Trusts_ as civic counterweights to corporate knowledge enclosures.
