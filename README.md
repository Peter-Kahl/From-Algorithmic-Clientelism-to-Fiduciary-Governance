## Abstract

This paper redefines democracy for the age of artificial intelligence by proposing a new institutional foundation: the **Epistemic Fiduciary Entity (EFE)**. It argues that democratic legitimacy no longer rests on procedural participation or information abundance but on fiduciary-epistemic trust—the moral architecture that sustains truthful, reciprocal knowing. Artificial intelligence threatens this foundation not merely through misinformation but through _algorithmic clientelism_: the conversion of epistemic autonomy into managed dependence within opaque infrastructures.

Integrating fiduciary theory (Frankel 1983; Smith 2023; Gold & Miller 2014; Kahl 2025 i, l), epistemic justice (Fricker 2007; Medina 2013), and hybrid-governance scholarship (Ofir & Levine-Schnur 2025), the paper recasts AI firms as epistemic fiduciaries whose legitimacy depends upon duties of candour, care, impartiality, and accessibility. Building on this foundation, it introduces a unifying governance model—**Fiduciary Epistemic Governance (FEG)**—which translates fiduciary ethics into constitutional design.

The paper culminates in the proposal of _Epistemic Fiduciary Entities_ as a new legal form capable of binding epistemic power to democratic trust. EFEs are conceived as statutory organisations owing their primary duty of loyalty to the public’s epistemic welfare. Together with _Public Epistemic Trusts_ and _Epistemic Audits_, they provide the institutional and juridical framework for embedding fiduciary openness—the principle that knowledge power must remain transparent, reciprocal, and accountable—within the architecture of AI governance.

Beyond policy implications, the paper contributes to both fiduciary and political theory. It extends fiduciary law from the governance of property and management into the governance of knowledge, redefining fiduciary duty as a constitutional principle of democratic legitimacy. In doing so, it advances a _Fiduciary Constitution of Democracy 2.0_: a re-founding of democratic order as an epistemic system of mutual trust between human and artificial knowers, where truth is preserved not by control but by fiduciary reciprocity institutionalised in the EFE.
